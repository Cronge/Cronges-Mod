# Cronge's Mod 
Cronge's Mod is mod that I created to learn the craft of Minecraft Modding! <br/>
Built with [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net).
</div>
<!-- Description -->

I've always been fascinated by mods, and it was an interesting topic to me, so I decided to learn how to make one! <br/>
I'm currently watching Kaupenjoe's [Minecraft 1.19 Fabric Modding Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1EeLZggaXPJaARxnAbUD8Y_).

<!-- *I had another mod, but I messed with Git and lost all my work. So I decided to restart.* -->

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: *I do not plan on releasing Cronge's Mod yet, but I might consider releasing it in the future.*

Cronge's Mod requires both [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer) and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to work. <br/>
A tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7gmfib4gHg) to install Fabric Loader and Fabirc API respectively.

*Note: It is also recomended to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and other fabric performance mods with Cronge's Mod to enhance your playing experience.*

## Features
Well, this mod doesn't really have any featuresâ€”I'm just following along with Kaupenjoe as I watch his tutorials.
