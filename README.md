# Cronge's Mod 1.19
  
A mod that I created to learn modding!

I've always been fascinated by mods, and it was an interesting topic to me, so I decided to learn how to make one! <br/>
I'm currently watching Kaupenjoe's [Minecraft 1.19 Fabric Modding Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1EeLZggaXPJaARxnAbUD8Y_).

## Getting Started

### Installation

*I do not plan on releasing the mod yet, but I might consider releasing it in the future.*

## Features
Well, this mod doesn't really have any featuresâ€”I'm just following along with Kaupenjoe as I watch his tutorials.
