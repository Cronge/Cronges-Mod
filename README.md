## Cronge's Mod 1.19

I've always been fascinated by mods, so I decided to learn how to make one!
I'm currently watching Kaupenjoe's [Minecraft 1.19 Fabric Modding Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1EeLZggaXPJaARxnAbUD8Y_).

*I had another mod, but I messed up with Git and lost all my work. So I decided to go back to the beggining*
